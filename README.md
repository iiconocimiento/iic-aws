### Rigoembeddings

**Rigoembeddings** is a text embedding model in Spanish that excels in its accuracy and ability to capture the semantic meaning of words in various contexts. It can be used as a building block for advanced NLP applications and benefits across a wide range of fields. 

The main applications of this model include NLP, where it enhances text comprehension and generation, facilitating the creation of chatbots, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), virtual assistants, and recommendation systems among others. 

### RigoChat-7b

RigoChat-7b is the second version of RigoChat, a family of Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to solve typical NLP tasks with Spanish instructions such as Tool Use, Summarization, Math, Code, Abstractive-QA, etc.

This model has no specific use case and can be applied to a wide range of tasks. Indeed, it offers an improvement for generalist tasks in Spanish, particularly in RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation) systems with Spanish databases, as its training focused on resolving questions about contexts to prevent hallucinations and ensure safe responses.

### ERAS - Easy Reading Analyzer for Spanish
